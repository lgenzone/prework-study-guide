# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## This webpage was created to provide a location to store and organize information learned during the Prework section of coding bootcamp. Because bootcamp students are studying a substantial amount of new information, I'm hoping that this webpage will serve as a place to keep notes in a structured manner. This solves the issue if being unable to find newly learned material in one place. Not only have I learned some of the basics of coding, but I've also had the opportunity to create my first webpage!
